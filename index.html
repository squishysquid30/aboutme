<!--1st paragraph-->
  <p>Vinicunca is a rainbow mountain. This mountain is located in Cusco Peru. The multiple different colors are caused because of the oxidation of their minerals. I have always wanted to go to Vinicunca. I think it would be a very interesting place to visit.</p>

<!--2nd paragraph-->
  <p>Lake Hillier is a pink lake. It is located in Australia. The lake is as salty as the dead sea. It is pink because of the algae and halobacteria living in it. Visiting Lake Hillier would be very fun and it would be interesting to swim in a pink lake.</p>

  <p>The top piece is a box that looks like a cake. I made my box into a slice of cheese and the added topping to it to make it look like a cake so it is a cheesecake. The second project is a bowl that I threw on a wheel. I marbled the glaze by pouring the purple,pink, and white glaze in a container together. I then poured the glaze over the bowl.</p>
